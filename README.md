# Basic Cipher Decryption

This program decrypts a message encrypted with a simple [substitution cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher).

As an example of a potential cipher used:

Plaintext alphabet: 	ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

Ciphertext alphabet: 	ZEBRASCDFGHIJKLMNOPQTUVWXY


   


A phrase encrypted using this cipher: 

DAIIL VLOIR QAPQFKC LKA QVL QDOAA FQP OAZIIX IZQA

(Can you figure out what it says?)

^ Sample run of the program

Notes: Perhaps my favorite project from the whole semester. The only downside is the way my professor wanted it implemented (for simplicity) was to not allow characters other than letters or spaces. So no '!,;:" and the like allowed. And all upper case characters are just converted to lower case. These are common punctuation characters so it can be very frustrating. If I find the time this summer I would like to go back and adapt the program to accept these types of characters.
